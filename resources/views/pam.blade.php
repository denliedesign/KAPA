                        My name is Pamela Herbert and I am honored and excited to introduce myself to you as a new private voice and piano instructor at Kenosha Academy of Performing Arts! Music has been a part of my life since I was a very young child, as I began singing with my family at the age of 5. I earned my degree in music, specifically Voice and Vocal Pedagogy from North Park College in Chicago, where I had many wonderful opportunities to perform. Some of my performance experience includes several seasons with Light Opera Works of Evanston, roles in several operas such as Mimi in Puccini’s La Bohéme and Bess in Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess and many others! I also had the opportunity to perform in Master classes as well as coach with Dr. Elizabeth Buccheri, the senior accompanist at both the Chicago Symphony and Lyric Opera. Since then, I have worked in Music, both in the classroom for 21 years and my private voice and piano studio at home and at Loyola Academy, Steps Performing Arts Center in Lindenhurst and Standing Ovation Theatre in Gurnee, totaling 32 years. I have also been blessed to be the Assistant Music Director at St. Martha Parish in Morton Grove, and as the full Director of Music at St. Emily Parish in Mt. Prospect. I had the joy of working not only as a parish accompanist, but directing a Filipino/American Choir as well as the Children’s Choir, several adult choirs and a handbell choir. I now look forward to being able to provide an outlet through music for you and your children at KAPA! Thank you for your welcome and support! I look forward to meeting all of you!
