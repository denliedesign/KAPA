                                    Our studio is a place where dancers can feel safe and encouraged while they build excellence and confidence in their art form. All our instructors are YPAD certified which means they are background checked, CPR and safety trained, and follow measures to ensure a Safer Studio.
                                    There is no other dance studio in Racine WI that is as certified, trained, and dedicated to your child's well-being as our staff is here at KAPA.
